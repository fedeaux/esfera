
Annotation components
==============================
AnnotationPanel.html contains the UI controls for selecting tools, annotation properties and listing annotations.

CustomTools.js contains a custom annotation and its corresponding custom tool.

ReaderControl.js has the option to enable or disable annotations

DocumentViewer.AnnotationManager manages all annotations and its states associated with the document.

Steps to creating a custom annotation
=============================================
-create a new annotation object, extending from one of the Annotations base class (e.g. Annotations.MarkupAnnotations)

-override the draw method with custom code

-draw method takes a canvas context as parameter, do all canvas drawing here


Steps to creating a custom annotation tool
=============================================
-create a new tool object, extending from the Tools base class

-override UI event callback methods as required
(mouseLeftDown, mouseMove, keyDown, etc.)

-call the base class's method on overridden methods to ensure that mouse page coordinates are set properly
(by default, 2 page coordinates are set: first point when mouse left down, second point when mouse is dragged or when mouse left up)

-in one of the callbacks, create a new instance of Annotation.
-use the annotation manager to add, delete or modify annotation.
(DocumentViewer.GetAnnotationManager())


-register the custom annotation tool with DocumentViewer
(e.g. exports.CoreControls.DocumentViewer.prototype.ToolModes.CustomLine = CustomLineTool;)


-lastly, add a new tool item to AnnotationPanel.html
(when the new tool item is clicked, set the DocumentViewer's tool mode to the newly registered custom tool)



Creating annotations programmatically
==========================================
-Create the annotations during onDocumentLoaded in ReaderControl
1. load the annotations from xml
2. create directly by creating new Annotation objects, and adding them to the annotation manager through AnnotationManager.AddAnnotations();
